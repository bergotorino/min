MIN can execute test cases also directly from the command line.  User can tell MIN not to start the console UI with @code{--console} (or @code{-c}) command line switch. If @code{-c} is the only switch MIN executes all the test cases in all the modules configured in the @code{min.conf} file. MIN can also be instructed to omit the module definitions in @code{min.conf} and execute the cases from a test module specified on the command line with switch @code{--execute} (or @code{-x}). 

@example
maemo@@maemo:~$ min --console --execute /usr/lib/min/minDemoModule.so\
--execute /usr/lib/min/scripter.so:.min/script.cfg

Note that it's possible to pass also one or more configuration files to the test module from command line (as in the example above). 

MIN does not show the printouts from test module wants on the screen, when the @code{-c} switch is specified. It only shows the test case that is running and the result of the test case when it is completed.

If the @code{-x} switch is used without the @code{-c} switch the console UI is started, but only the test module specified on the command line is visible in the menus.
