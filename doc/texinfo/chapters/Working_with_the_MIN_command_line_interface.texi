MIN can execute test cases also directly from the command line.  User can tell MIN not to start the console UI with @code{--console} (or @code{-c}) command line switch. If @code{-c} is the only switch MIN executes all the test cases in all the modules configured in the @code{min.conf} file. MIN can also be instructed to omit the module definitions in @code{min.conf} and execute the cases from a test module specified on the command line with switch @code{--execute} (or @code{-x}). 

@example
$ min --console --execute /usr/lib/min/minDemoModule.so
         message from "Demo_1": this is from the Demo module
02:34:36 Passed     /usr/lib/min/minDemoModule.so:"Demo_1" - PASSED
         message from "Demo_2": this is from case Demo_2
02:34:41 Passed     /usr/lib/min/minDemoModule.so:"Demo_2" - PASSED
@end example

Note that it's possible to pass also one or more configuration files to the test module from command line. 

In case there are printouts from test case, those are also shown.

If the @code{-x} switch is used without the @code{-c} switch the console UI is started, but only the test module specified on the command line is visible in the menus.

Similarly with switches @code{-t} and @code{-r}, only the test cases with title matching the given title or regular expression are shown.

@example
$ min -cr Demo_[1-2]
message from "Demo_1": this is from the Demo module
02:40:22 Passed     minDemoModule.so:"Demo_1" - PASSED
         message from "Demo_2": This is from case Demo_2
02:40:28 Passed     minDemoModule.so:"Demo_2" - PASSED
@end example
