The @code{slave_allocate} functionality allocates slave device which is needed for remote test case execution. As parameters it takes slave type and slave name. It returns a handle to the slave which is then used for calling methods on slave.

Available slave types are: SlaveTypePhone and SlaveTypeTablet

Example:
@example
function case_alloc() - slave_allocate example
	slavehnd = min.slave_allocate(SlaveTypePhone,"Slave1");
end
@end example
Note that the allocated slave must be freed.
