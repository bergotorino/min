The @code{unset} keyword is used to unset a state event. Every @code{set} state event must be @code{unset}. Indication events cannot be unset. @code{unset} blocks until everyone who has requested the specified event has released the event.
@code{unset} has one mandatory argument, which is described below.
@table @b
@item Argument
@item Event
The event name.
@end table
The unset keyword can be used, for example, in the following way:
