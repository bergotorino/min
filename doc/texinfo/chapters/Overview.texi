Test interference allows programmers to execute test cases in system under stress - for some components it might be useful to see, how the code behaves if the CPU is busy, when other processes are eating up memory and so on. To simulate system load, MIN uses tools contained in sp-stress package, which is a part of Maemo SDK. Tools can simulate: cpu load, memory usage and IO operations. Test interference is usable in "coded" ("hardcoded", MINUnit and so on), as well as in scripted test cases. Tools from sp-stress package are executed in process running in parallel to test case.
