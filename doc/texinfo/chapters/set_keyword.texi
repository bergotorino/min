The @code{set} keyword is used to set an event. Every @code{set} state event must be explicitly unset.

@code{set} has one mandatory argument and also one optional argument, as described below.

@table @b
@item Argument
@item Event
The event name.
@item Optional argument
@item State
If a state is given, sets the state event, otherwise sets an indication event. A state event remains set until it is unset explicitly with the unset keyword. An indication event is set only once to every requester and implicitly unset after that.
@end table

The set keyword can be used, for example, in the following ways:

@example
set Event1
set Event2 state
@end example
