The @code{wait} keyword is used to wait for an event. A request must be called before wait, and @code{wait} blocks until the requested event is set. @code{wait} may proceed immediately if the requested event is a state event and already pending (for example, a phone call is already active). @code{wait} has one mandatory argument, which is described below.
@table @b
@item Argument
@item Event
The event name.
@end table
The wait keyword can be used, for example, in the following way:
@example
wait Event1
@end example
