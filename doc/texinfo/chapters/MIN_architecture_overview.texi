The architecture is divided into three main layers: the interface layer, the engine layer and the test layer. The arrows show the direction of the data flow. 

Figure below shows an overview of the MIN architecture.

The architecture of MIN is modular. The interface between the modules is either a function call or IPC interface. There are no cyclic dependencies between the modules. The user interface module uses MIN Engine, MIN Engine uses Test Module Controller(s) and Test Module Controller uses test module.

Main modules are listed in Table below.

The MIN modules on the interface layer are described in Section @ref{MIN modules on the interface layer}. The MIN Engine module on the engine layer is described in Section @ref{MIN module on the engine layer} and the MIN modules on the test layer are described in Section @ref{MIN modules on the test layer}.
