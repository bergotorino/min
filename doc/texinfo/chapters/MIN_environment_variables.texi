MIN supports currently (as of @code{2010w10}) environment variable that can be used to control if Scipter testclass symbols are validated during MIN Script syntax validation. Unless @code{$SCRIPTER_SYMBOL_VALIDATION} is set to @code{1}, the symbol validation is skipped. Validating the symbols means also loading the testclass library, which may cause problems if there are initialisations planned to be executed only once (in @code{ts_get_test_cases()}).
