MIN supports currently (as of @code{2010w10}) environment variable that can be used to control if Scipter testclass symbols are validated during MIN Script syntax validation. If @code{$SCRIPTER_NO_SYMBOL_VALIDATION} is set to @code{1}, the symbol validation is skipped. This feature is usefull if the testclass contains initializations that should not be executed more than once in function @code{ts_get_test_cases()}.
