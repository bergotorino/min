It is possible to use C++ inside MIN test modules. Currently (since version 2009w24) a version of Test Module Template Wizard, which creates C++ enabled test module templates, is shipped with MIN. The tool is invoked with command @code{createtestmodule++} and has exactly the same use as the traditional wizard (@code{createtestmodule}).
