MIN Parser is divided into three main parts: @code{MinParser}, @code{MinSectionParser} and @code{MinItemParser} (see figure below).

MIN Parser supports hierarchical parsing for:
@itemize
@item Sections
@item Subsections
@item Lines
@item Strings
@item Characters
@item Integers
@end itemize

MIN Parser also supports INCLUDE command. See the following limitations of this feature:
@itemize
@item INCLUDE keyword must be written in capital letters and must start from the first column of the line.
@item File name (with path and extension) must follow INCLUDE command. Rest of line would be ignored.
@item All files included from Unicode file should also be in Unicode format (and vice versa).
@item Loops in includes are not allowed (for example incorrect situation is when file A includes file B and file B includes file A). In that case, the second include will be ignored, and MIN will continue working).
@end itemize
