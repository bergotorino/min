The test object name can be considered as a temporary keyword, which is valid between its creation with the @code{createx} keyword and its deletion with the @code{delete} keyword. The object name is used to call methods from a test object. The method name is given as the first argument for the object name, and the method may have arguments, which are forwarded to the test class method.
For example: 
@example
TestObjectName MethodName <method arguments 1 2 3>.
@end example
