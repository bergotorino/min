The @code{wait} functionality is used for waiting for requested event. Event might be requested before wait is used, but this is not a must. If event has not been requested it will be requested and released in wait function. As a parameters wait takes event name and optional event type which can be StateEvent or IndicationEvent. By default it is IndicationEvent.
Example:
@example
function case_function() -- wait example state event
	min.wait("Event1");
end

function case_function() -- wait example 2 state event
	min.request("Event1");
	min.wait("Event1");
	min.release("Event1");
end

function case_function() -- wait example state event
	min.wait("Event1",IndicationEvent);
end

function case_function() -- wait example 2 state event
	min.request("Event1",IndicationEvent);
	min.wait("Event1",IndicationEvent);
	min.release("Event1",IndicationEvent);
end
@end example
Note that it is a must to wait for an event of the type the event has been requested.
