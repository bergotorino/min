To debug a test case, go to @b{Debug case} under the @b{Case} menu and select the case you want to debug from list. MIN leaves ncurses temprorarily, starts the selected test case and attaches debugger (configured in @code{min.conf}) file to the test process running the case. The execution should stop in a @code{sleep()} function just before the test function is called. Note that in order to succesfully return the execution back to MIN ConsoleUI, you should detach the debugger latest at the end of test function.
