Each test case is a method exported from Test Module. First of all it is a must to load Lua Test Class as a Test Module, then you can call each test function as follows:
@example
function case_function() -- load test
	foo = min.load("Bar");
	foo.Example();
	min.unload(foo);
	return TP_PASSED;
end
@end example

Note that the following call:
@example
foo.Example();
@end example
is referring to the test function name given in ENTRY macro. It is not the real test function name.
