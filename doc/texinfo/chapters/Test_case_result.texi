Test cases defined in Lua scripting language return their results by value (as they are functions). Two macros are provided: @code{TP_PASSED} and @code{TP_FAILED}.

Example:
@example
function case_function() -- This is a title
	Return TP_PASSED;
end

function case_function() -- This is a title
	Return TP_FAILED;
end
@end example
