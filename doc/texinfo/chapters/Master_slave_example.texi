This simple example runs the first case in @code{minDemoModule} in two slaves of type ``desktop'' and ``laptop''.

In the @code{min.conf} we have specified the slaves as in previous chapter. The master script could then look as follows.

@example
[Test]
title run minDemodule in two slaves
allocate desktop slave1
remote slave1 run minDemoModule  dummy.cfg 1
free slave1
allocate laptop slave2
remote slave2 run minDemoModule  dummy.cfg 1
free slave2
[Endtest]
@end example
