Currently, three interfaces are supported in MIN:
@itemize @bullet
@item MIN Console UI
@item MIN Command line interface (limited)
@item MIN EXT interface
@end itemize

The UI is used to start the test case execution. The UI can also show information about the test case progress to the user.

The interface modules have access to the engine functionality. There exists several asynchronous functions in Test Engine, and therefore the user interface has to handle several ongoing asynchronous requests. 

The MIN Console UI is used to manually start the test case execution.

The command line interface can be used, for example, to execute all the test cases of all configured test module(s).
