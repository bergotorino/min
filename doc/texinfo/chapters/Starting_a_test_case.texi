To start a single test case, go to @b{Start new case} under the @b{Case} menu and select a particular case from the list. MIN Console UI starts to execute the chosen test case. A new test case can be started while another is still executed. When several cases are executed at the same time, they are executed in separate processes.

To start multiple test cases, go to @b{Run multiple tests} under the @b{Case} menu and select/mark test cases to be executed from the list and run selected test case either sequentially or in parallel.
