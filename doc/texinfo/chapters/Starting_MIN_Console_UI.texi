To start the MIN Console UI from the command line, type (note that MIN have to be installed):
@example
min
@end example

When MIN starts it checks if:
@enumerate
@item there is already MIN running
@item there are TMC processes
@item there is message queue left behind.
@end enumerate

When a MIN instance is found during startup, the default behavior is to ask the user if they want it to be killed (this behavior can be changed by using the -f parameter. @xref{Startup parameters}. )

When starting MIN, it searches min.conf file from following locations:
@enumerate
@item Current working directory
@item @code{/home/<user name>/.min}
@item @code{/etc}
@end enumerate
