The @code{allownextresult} keyword is used to add valid result values for a method and for asynchronous commands. The default value for the expected result is 0, and if a value is set with allownextresult, 0 is removed from the expected values. A method may either return or leave with the specified result. Every method call removes all allowed results. That is, after every method call, the default value 0 is again the only expected result value. Either multiple allownextresult keywords can be placed before a method call or @code{allownextresult} keyword can have multiple parameters.
