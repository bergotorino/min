MIN Text interface is designed to be used, to handle C strings allocated on the heap, without worrying about the amount of memory needed to be allocated. Text interface can grow or shrink automatically.

MIN Text interface is always allocated on the heap by using tx_create method. It is required by the end user to free all allocated resource by calling tx_destroy on it.
