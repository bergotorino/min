The optional @code{description} keyword can be used to give more elaborate description for test case. The description is placed after the keyword. The @code{description} keyword can appear multiple times and anywhere in the test case. The descriptions are combined as the test case is parsed. For example:
@example
description Create, print, 
description run example and delete
@end example
