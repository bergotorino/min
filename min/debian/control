Description: A test framework for C
 The MIN test framework provides a toolset for creating and executing test cases. Test cases are compiled into module(s).
 MIN engine starts a Test Module Controller (TMC) for each test module. TMC in turn forks a process for each test case when the test is executed. 
 Tests are run in own process so that e.g. segfaults can be caught and handled. MIN can be operated via console UI (ncurses) or from the commandline.
